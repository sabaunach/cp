n numbers
decide if there is a triple of points
s.t. x + y = z

simplest meet-in-the-middle sol (on n^2)

sum of all pair of numbers = n^2
sort sums
sort nums and in binary search compare to see if there is anything summing up to that pair of nums


backtracking may work
pruning may work
but MITM may be the cleanest / fastest to impl




general idea
split dataset in half
solve with exponential time
binary search: compare objects in left set w/ objects in right set
& see if gives sol
